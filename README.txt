The folder "HENM1314g3" needs to be put into the root folder of the local ROLE SDK installation.
Once the local ROLE server is started the widgets can be added to a space via the URL

http://127.0.0.1:8073/role/henm1314g3/{WIDGET_FILE_NAME}

where {WIDGET_FILE_NAME} is the name of the widget xml file.

The widgets are also accesible under

role-sandbox.eu/spaces/boostdemo
